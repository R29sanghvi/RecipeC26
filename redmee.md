# Macarons are fluffy, light and delightfull goodies. They're small light biscuits, crunchy outside and soft inside!!

# They can be had as tea time snacks, as travel goodies, desert and much more!

# These French meringue-based biscuits are refreshing and soothing on the pallete.

These pretty little buiscuits are loved by all!! 

Hope you enjoy them as well :)
